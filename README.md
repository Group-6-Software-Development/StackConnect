# StackConnect

**Web Project for Software Development - WebDev Course**

StackConnect is a job-seeking platform designed for programmers, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). This platform allows developers to create profiles, search for job opportunities, and connect with potential employers.

## Live Demo

You can explore the live demo of the project at: [StackConnect Live Demo](https://stackconnect.onrender.com/)

## Project Overview

The development of StackConnect is divided into four sprints, with each sprint building upon the previous one. The final version of the project can be found in the [Sprint 4 directory](https://github.com/Group-6-Software-Development/StackConnect/tree/main/Sprint_4).

## Sprint Breakdown
