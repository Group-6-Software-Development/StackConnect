## Target Users and Stakeholders

Users: Coders, Job Seekers
Stakeholders: Companies, Recruiters

## Main Functionality

The "StackConnect" project aims to create a web-based platform that caters to both coders seeking job opportunities and companies looking to hire skilled coders. The main functionalities include:

### User Authentication

Users can log in as either "COMPANY" or "CODER," each with distinct privileges.

### Company Features

Companies can select a coding area they are seeking talent in (e.g., Junior Web Developer) and view a visual listing of available coders for job placement or interviews.
Companies can post job openings with specific requirements, similar to popular job platforms like Duunitori or LinkedIn.

### Coder Features

Coders can check for job invitations from companies and accept them.
Coders can explore job listings posted by companies and apply for positions by sending their information.

### Optional Social Platform

If time is not an issue, the project will also include a "Twitter"-like social platform where both companies and users can share their opinions and engage in discussions.
